                   2. `4` is already a defined number, and it doesn't make sense to make a number be a name for something else. In Python, "`x = 2 + 2`" means "assign `x` as the name for the value of `2 + 2`."
                  
                   3. It should be `2 + 2 = 4`.

The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girlsâ€™ future potential as earners.

                         In the cell below, compute this value and call it `biggest_change`. Use a single expression (a single line of code) to compute the answer. Let Python perform all the arithmetic (like subtracting 49 from 67) rather than simplifying the expression yourself. The built-in `abs` function takes a numerical input and returns the absolute value. The built-in `max` function can take in 3 arguments and returns the maximum of the three numbers.

                         **Question:**  The final paragraph of the CNN report said that "several eye specialists" had pointed out that the study should have accounted for heredity.
                         Myopia is passed down from parents to children. Myopic parents are more likely to have myopic children, and may also be more likely to leave lights on habitually (since the parents have poor vision). In what way does the knowledge of this possible genetic link affect how we interpret the data from the study
                         
                         **Student's Task:** 
                         Express your opinion and response as a string in `response` in the `hw1_exercise_15` function.
      
                         **Review Criteria:**
      
                         - The students are expected to express their opinion as `response` in the `hw1_exercise_15` function. Their response must be logical and reasonable given the context of the question. 
                         - **Note:** You can only claim that a student is yet to attempt the problem if the placeholders i.e "Your response here" still exists in the function block instead of an answer attempt.
                         - **Note:** Critique the students opinion or answer by pointing out the flaws if their answer is off point or acknowledging the points raised if correct. Give subtle hints if the response is not completely correct.
